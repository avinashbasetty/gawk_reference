To test whether gawk is installed, try below link
awk 1 /dev/null
In this case you should find a version of new awk, or install gawk

Basic function of **awk** is to search files for lines that contains patterns . when line matches pattern awk performs specific action on that line.
awk continues to process this way until it reaches end of line.

AWK programs are data driven. AWK program contains series of rules. Each rule contains one pattern to search and one action to perform upon finding the pattern.

syntactically, rule contains pattern followed by action.
pattern { action }
pattern { action }

awk ’program’ input-file1 input-file2 ...

There is a single quote character in program, so the shell wont interpret any awk character as special shell character. This also treat all program in single argument

Running awk without input files:-
awk 'program'

 !#>awk 'BEGIN {print "Don\47t Panic!"}'
 O/P: Don't Panic!
 
 awk emulates cat utility, which copies every thing on keyboard to its standard output. press ctrl+d to exit
awk '{print}'

Running Long programs:
Sometimes, programs will be long. In this cases, it is convinient to write in seperate file.
awk -f sourcefile inputfile1 inputfile2

The -f instructs the utility to get awk program from the file. 

For example : 
'BEGIN {print "Don\47t panic!"}

save the file as advice. Then command will be awk -f advice

you can also run file directly by using self contained script mechanism.

#! /usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN {print "Don\47t Panic!"}

Comment in awk:
all comments start with number sign character (‘#’)

Leading backslash are stripped first 
 awk "BEGIN {print \"Don't panic\"}"

This can be simplified
awk "BEGIN {print \"Here is the single quote<'''>\" }"


Magic Digits 
47 - '
42 - ""

Another option will work nicely, but should comment clearly with escape mean
